Modeling Complex Damage
1) Damage should be scalable and translatable (flat damage reduction and % damage reduction)
2) Damage sources should be allowed to be dimished sequentially (damage reductions should stack in complex ways)
3) Damage should result in complex behavior (destruction of damage reducers out-of-order, for example)
    a) Bones breaking without skin being shorn off
    b) Damage penetrating skin and continuing to do damage to muscle as skin sloughs off
    c) Extreme temperatures penetrating the effects of an ironskin potion to freeze the skin

Damage Reducers / Absorbers
1) Each layer in a composition should provide a damage absorber model, which reduces damage to sub-layers possibly at the expense of is own integrity
2) Layers should be linkable to an object, upon whose destruction the damage absorber no longer applies
3) Layer order should be respected
4) Layers should respond to complex triggers (ironskin potion might be negated by an acid potion, or might just wear off after a period of time)

Composition Creation
1) Compositions will need to allow the specification of layer order
2) Compositions should respect layer order during construction and subsequent calculations that involve layering
